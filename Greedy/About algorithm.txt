Greedy algorithm : simply looks the best at the current moment.

a) Change Making Problem
b) Minimum Spanning Tree Problem
  • Using Prim’s greedy algorithm
  • Using Kruskal’s greedy algorithm
c) Shortest paths from a single-Source to many destinations Problem
  ▪ Dijkstra’s greedy Algorithm
d) Constructing Huffman Code Tree for Data compression Problem
  ▪ Huffman Entropy Coding Algorithm 

Like dynamic programming,
Greedy algorithm design pattern solves optimization(Maximization/Minimization) problems.

This gives local optimal solution and it may or may not give global optimal solution.
